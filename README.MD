# Quest Icon Desaturation
At quest givers, this AddOn will desaturate (turn grey) the icons for quests that you have not yet completed.

## Icon grey even though you can complete the quest?
Some quests are not marked "Completed" in the quest log, even though when you talk to the quest NPC you are able to complete it.  If you find a quest like this, please let me know what it is so I can fix it!
